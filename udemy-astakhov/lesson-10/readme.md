In this lesson I've watched how Denis has set up web server under load balancer.<br>
Steps:
- get availability zones
- get needed ami id in your region
- create security group
- create subnets (retrieve default subnets)
- create launch configuration (for setup our server)
- create load balancer (for managing our server by observing its state)
- create auto scaling group (for auto scale our servers under the load)
