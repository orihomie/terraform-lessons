Terraform Basics

In this lection I've leraned:<br>
- `tf plan` to see what planned to be done by terraform
- `tf apply` to apply planned changes
- `tf destroy` to destroy all resources from .tf file in current directory

I've also learned how to configure credentials. For that I've needed to install `awscli`:<br>
`brew install awscli`<br>.

Then run `aws configure` and after that create `variables.tf` file.
