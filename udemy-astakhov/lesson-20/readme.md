# Project Structure

In this lesson I've learned that I need to<br>
- separate everything into folders
- keep the state of separated staff remotely
- sync them by remote state
- keep remote state in a similar to a local folder paths


For example, lets say we have a project called "Meta", this is how it's structure would look like<br>
-modules
-Meta
--env-stage
---vpc
---instances
---dbs
---s3
--env-prod
---vpc
---instances
---dbs
---s3
